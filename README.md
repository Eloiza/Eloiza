## I'm Eloiza Rossetto :smiley_cat:
 
I'm graduated to Biomedical Informatics at UFPR. I currently work mostly with Python and C Programming Language. My interests are machine learning algorithms, computer vision and data analysis. Here there are some random projects and some of my coolest works that I've done during my college. I hope that you can find something that you also thinks it's cool or helpful to you :)

Thanks for visiting o/
